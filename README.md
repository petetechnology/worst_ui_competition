# Worst UI Competition

Welcome to the **Worst UI Competition**! The challenge here is to design the most atrocious, confusing, and laughably bad user interface for a web application. While the theme is open-ended, we encourage you to take on a specific challenge: **a scoring system for judges at the Olympic Games**.

## Objective

Your task is to create a scoring system that’s so poorly designed it would leave even the most experienced Olympic judges scratching their heads. We’re looking for a UI that defies all user experience best practices—whether it’s impossible to navigate, overloaded with irrelevant information, or just plain absurd. The more frustrating, the better!

## Creativity and Technical Execution

We want to see just how creative you can get while still demonstrating your technical skills. There are no limits on the technology you can use, but frameworks like React or Vue might give you the edge you need to execute your hilariously bad ideas.

## Styling

Remember, while the UI should be functionally terrible, it doesn’t have to be ugly. A beautifully styled but utterly incomprehensible interface could be just as effective. We recommend using a styling framework like Tailwind CSS to add that extra layer of polish to your disastrously bad design.

## Resources

Here are some resources to help you get started:

- [React Documentation](https://react.dev/)
- [Vue.js Documentation](https://vuejs.org/)
- [Tailwind CSS Documentation](https://tailwindcss.com/)

## Examples

For some inspiration, check out the following video on YouTube that showcases examples of hilariously bad UI designs:

Feel free to draw ideas from these examples, but remember, the goal is to create something uniquely terrible and your own!

### Get ready to create a scoring system that would make the Olympic Games unforgettable—for all the wrong reasons!
