# Worst UI Competition - Random Letter Keyboard 🎹

## Description
The **Worst UI Competition** is a project featuring a virtual keyboard that randomly shuffles the letters on its keys after a set interval or when a key is pressed. This project utilizes HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to create a deliberately confusing and playful user interface.

## Features ✨

- **Random Key Values:** The letters on the virtual keyboard change randomly every 1.8 seconds.
- **Key Types:** The keyboard includes numeric keys, letters, and special keys like "espaço" and "apagar."
- **Input Recording:** Each time a key is pressed, its value is recorded and displayed in the form fields.
- **Delete Functionality:** Pressing the "apagar" key removes the last character entered.
- **Space Key:** Pressing the "espaço" key adds a blank space to the sequence.
- **Responsive Design:** The page design adapts to different screen sizes (desktop and mobile).

## Technologies Used 🛠️

- **HTML5:** For the page structure.
- **CSS3:** For styling the interface, including responsiveness.
- **JavaScript:** For keyboard manipulation logic and random letter shuffling.

## Customization ⚙️

If you want to change the interval between key reshuffles, you can modify the value in the `setInterval` method in the `src/js/index.js` file:

```javascript
setInterval(mudarLetras, 1800); // Change 1800 to the desired value (in milliseconds)
